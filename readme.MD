# Bashed : Automate your terminal and workflow

> If it can be done in bash, it can be automated.

These are some of the bash terminal commands I created and use everyday to automate my workflow and to make programming more fun and accessible. Hopefully these commands are useful to you.
## Features

- Automating daily simple commands as "cdi"=> mkdir + cd into a project.
- Project specific commands, eg: "repo" => Opens the current project git repo in default browser.
- Git commands such as gim which provides feature headings you set to all your commit messages, you can check this project commit messages.
- Bash commands such as "reload", no longer do you need to closer and open your terminal again to run updated bashrc file.
- Network commands such as "port", "port 5000" would open localhost:5000 in your default browser.
- Constant updates as I need and use these every day : )

## Tech
- [Bash] - All shell scripts are for bash, I havent tried or tested in other shells!

### Why I wrote this project and how you can help
> Life is too short to not automate.

If I catch myself writing commands twice, that is sign for me to automate it.
I am sharing this and making it open source so everyone can use it and as well as help me make it better.
Contribute if you have any useful bash scripts you wrote. 
You can also contribute by suggesting some tasks that you wish was automated and would like to have, I will do my best to do it, chances are I might need them too.
Programming does not have to be a chore. In it's core, it is there because we are lazy to do things repeatedly. Hopefully this project is of some use to you.
I want this project to be accessible to everyone, I hope I can write a good documentation, feel free to suggest changes, report bugs, create PRs,anything that will make this project better. 
This project is for you, programmer.
